Another method to analyze whether the model is missing any meaningful information is to plot the residuals. The residuals are the actual values - the predicted values.

In this case, a linear regression fits the data very well as shown by the small and randomly distributed residuals. The random forest model appears to be having issues at the edges of the distribution.
