**Data Description**

This dataset contains records of sales calls to insurance customers.
It consists of a few easy-to-understand features on the customers being called (job, education type, marital status, age, account balance, etc.) and previous interactions (which channel? when? did it work?). The target column `CarInsurance` indicates whether the customer ended up buying a car insurance as a result of the call or not.
