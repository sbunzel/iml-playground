This dataset contains records of sales calls to insurance customers.
It consists of a few easy-to-understand features on the customers being called (job, education type, marital status, age, account balance, etc.) and previous interactions (which channel? when? did it work?). The target column `CarInsurance` indicates whether the customer ended up buying a car insurance as a result of the call or not.

It was provided as a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kondla/carinsurance) dataset.
